# Approov Service for NSURLSession 

A wrapper for the [Approov SDK](https://github.com/approov/approov-ios-sdk) to enable easy integration when using [`NSURLSession`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsurlsession) for making the API calls that you wish to protect with Approov. In order to use this you will need a trial or paid [Approov](https://www.approov.io) account.

See the [Quickstart](https://github.com/approov/quickstart-ios-objectivec-nsurlsession) for usage instructions.
